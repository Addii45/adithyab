<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I'm Adithya, a 4th year undergrad majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India. 

During my summer break, I had the opportunity to intern at the wonderful <a href='https://cni.iisc.ac.in/'>Center for Networked Intelligence Lab</a> at <a href='https://iisc.ac.in/'>IISc Bengaluru</a>.   
I was fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~rajeshs/'>Dr. Rajesh Sundaresan </a> and mentored by <a href='https://cni.iisc.ac.in/people/'>Dr. Jagadish Midthala</a>. We formulated a new variation of the de Bruijn Sequence and worked on finding its optimal lengths and other properties. You can find more about my work at the CNI lab in the research blog section.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis, basketball (rather poorly), and swimming. I am an avid fan of Roger Federer. I also enjoy cooking now and then. I mostly listen to hip-hop, but I also have a soft spot for Bollywood music (especially timeless tunes of the 2000s).

I grew up in the beautiful city of Bengaluru, India and I truly love the city. If you share similar interests or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to chat!
